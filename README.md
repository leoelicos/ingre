## Introduction

This six-page web app was an exercise in the appreciation of React, usually used with large web applications using complex state. It features a GlobalStore with React and Redux and Apollo client front-end and Apollo Server and Graph QL backend. The app allows users to login and save recipes to their recipes list without refreshing the page. They can also search recipes by category by clicking on filters. They can also pay with Stripe using a credit card.

On the front end, this Node application uses npm packages `@apollo/client`, `react` and `antd`.

On the back end, this application uses npm packages `apollo-server-express`, `graphql`, `jsonwebtoken` and `mongoose`.

I made this app in order to learn how to implement complex state on the front end.
